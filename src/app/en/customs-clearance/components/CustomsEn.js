                    product under the customs procedure is most often accompanied by the filing of a declaration for

                    It is important not to confuse the customs territory of the EAEU and the territory of the Russian
                    Federation (RF), they are different concepts! The Russian Federation is one of the member states of
                    the EEC. Now there are five of these states: the Republic Armenia, the Republic of Belarus, the
                    Republic of Kazakhstan, the Kyrgyz Republic and the Russian Federation. Together, these countries
                    form the customs territory of the EAEU, but not separately. This point is important if Your product
                    is being moved to/from the territory of one of these countries, as this affects the package
                    documents required for customs control, for customs declaration goods, the amount of customs duties
                    to be paid, and the conditions of use of the goods.
